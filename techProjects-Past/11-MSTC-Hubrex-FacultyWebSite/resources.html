		   <strong>PrintKey 2000</strong> is a great screen capture program that 
		   lets you print the contents of your screen. PrintKey 2000 also lets 
		   you print the desktop, active window or select a rectangular portion. 
		   You can also optionally include the cursor in the capture. There are 
		   options for stretching, centering, mirroring, and inverting the

		   <strong>Wordle</strong> is a toy for generating “word clouds” 
		   from text that you provide. The clouds give greater prominence to 
		   words that appear more frequently in the source text. You can tweak 
		   your clouds with different fonts, layouts, and color schemes. The 
		   images you create with Wordle are yours to use however you like. You 
		   can print them out, or save them to the Wordle gallery to share with 
		   your friends.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">http://www.wordle.net/</a>

		   <li><strong>Spell with Flickr</strong> remains one of my favorite 
		   cool &quot;tricks&quot; to share. Just go to the web site, enter a phrase, and 
		   it will generate a logo based on images in flickr of just letters and 
		   numbers. While on the site, you can click different letters to swap 
		   out individual letters.&nbsp; The site also offers code you can copy 
		   and paste to either repeat the exact same set of images, or another 
		   copy of code that is JavaScript and will dynamically create a new 
		   version each time the page loads.&nbsp;

		   <strong>Tagxedo</strong> turns words -- famous speeches, 
		   news articles, slogans and themes, even your love letters -- into a 
		   visually stunning tag cloud, words individually sized appropriately 
		   to highlight the frequencies of occurrence within the body of text.&nbsp;

		   <li><strong>TwitLogo</strong> - This is a new and interesting way to 
		   create your own logo by using a twitter application. It gives you a 
		   chance to add a personal touch to your logo by using your favorite 
		   colors with the “advanced options”. After you click on this 
		   alternative you will see three boxes appearing below the text box . 
		   These are the options you need to work with to determine your new 
		   logo’s font size , color as well as its outline color. When you are 
		   finished with this, you just need to download the image by pressing 
		   on the corresponding option.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.twitlogo.com/">
