		The following work samples are of learning aids that I have developed for my face-to-face classes and for Moodle teacher training sessions that I have taught.  These samples will demonstrate my use of the various technological tools available to me at these school districts.  My Portfolio for this meeting is available at <a href="http://hubrex.com/Portfolio/index.html" target="_blank">http://hubrex.com/Portfolio/index.html</a> <em><small>(<a href="docs/main.pdf" target="_blank">Print Version</a>)</small></em>.

		<li>GroupWise Packet</li>
		<blockquote>During my second year at New Berlin, I incorporated GroupWise email into all of my Computer Science courses.  Due to the fact that I taught students ranging from 7th to 12th grade I found that I needed a how-to resource for students to utilize in class as well as at home.  For this reason I created the GroupWise packet which provides students with detailed directions for logging on to GroupWise at school and at home, a brief tour of GroupWise, directions for sending emails, using the address book, and much more.</blockquote>
		<li>Online GroupWise Help</li>
		<blockquote>As more teachers began incorporating GroupWise into their curriculum I found a number of requests for copies of my GroupWise packet.  For this reason, I worked with the district web master to generalize the packet and make it available as a online GroupWise help resource for all students and teachers.  It can be found at <a href="http://www.nbexcellence.org/do_GroupWise_helps.cfm" target="_blank">http://www.nbexcellence.org/do_GroupWise_helps.cfm</a>.</blockquote>

	<li>Moodle Teacher Training Packet</li>
		<blockquote>In August the New Berlin School District offers a Teacher Technology Academy, which allows teachers to learn new technology and to also provide them an opportunity to create materials for their classroom.  During the 2008 Academy, I introduced, and helped teachers become familiar with Moodle as a classroom resource.  This packet is what I used as a guide for our three days together.  I designed it so the teachers would be able to also use it as a resource as they implemented Moodle in the classrooms throughout the school year.</blockquote>
		<li>Teacher Resource Moodle</li>
		<blockquote>I developed this Moodle course to be a play area for teachers as I introduced them to Moodle during the Teacher Technology Academy.  This course became a resource for the teachers to utilize as the school year progressed.  We shared ideas and posted resources as questions were brought up at our monthly support group meetings.  The resource that I would like to direct your attention to is the “Moodle How to Resources Book”.  In the future I would incorporate how-to video segments demonstrating how to add and/or use the activities and blocks available to teachers.</blockquote>


	<li>Moodle Student Handout</li>
		<blockquote>As I began introducing my students to Moodle I found that it made sense to them in the classroom, but when they needed to go home to complete their assignments at the beginning of the year they struggled.  This handout provides students with an introduction to Moodle as well as setup instructions for the beginning of the year.  This handout came in handy for the new teachers that started using Moodle last year, because many of them did not teach computers.  These teachers were able to introduce Moodle in the classroom and then take their students to the lab to follow these setup directions or they could send this home as a homework assignment.</blockquote>
	<li>Computer Science Student Resource Moodle</li>
	<blockquote>During the two years that I used Moodle with my Computer Science course, I tried various methods of introducing my students to Moodle.  The most efficient method that I found was to provide students with simple activities to complete with the purpose of helping them become comfortable with Moodle.  This course is a result of this effort.  Since the courses I taught build on each other I also found that I was providing the same resources to numerous classes and having to maintain documents in multiple locations.  For this reason, the Computer Science Resource course became a resource for files, course expectations, and a book that provided students with requirements and how-to’s.  As my students progress through the course sequences they will be familiar with this course and its resources.  The “Computer Science Requirements / How-to” book is another example of how I have provided my students with learning aides for commonly completed tasks.</blockquote>

	<li>Moodle End of Year Handout</li>
		<blockquote>As the year drew near its end, the new Moodling teachers had many questions about what they should do to save their hard work for the following year.  At our last meeting of the year  I provided  the teachers with this checklist style handout that they could use as a resource to close up their course for the year and prepare it for next fall.</blockquote>

	<li>Sennett Internal Employee Handbook</li>
		<blockquote>In an effort to make Internal Resources readily available to teachers at Sennett Middle School in Madison, I was tasked with taking our large employee binder and converting it into an online resource.  This site was made available on the schools Intranet site for security purposes.  It provides teachers with access to forms, policies, and procedures.   Due to this being an internal document I am unable to make this example available online, but I have brought along a version on my flash drive that I will share during our meeting.</blockquote>
