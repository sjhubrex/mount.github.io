                    In this chapter animating links were learned and experimented with.
                    The video shows an example of what was done with the links on the index
                    page, where when the mouse hovers over a specific word on the page
                    a different background color will appear.

                The animated links that have been embedded on this page is the heading of "Week 5",
                the heading of "Overall Thoughts", and the heading 1 of "Chapter 8." Each heading is
                linked the external style sheet by a "href=""" tag and is given the appropriate
                transitions, background color,  and many other details. As said each link has a set
                transition with how many seconds the transitions will be, and what color each transition
                will end up being.

                        The positives is that learning these links allows for more creativity
                        within the website, which helps it become more personable and interesting.
                        The links also have everything that has already been learned which made it
                        easier to build off knowledge that has already been learned.
