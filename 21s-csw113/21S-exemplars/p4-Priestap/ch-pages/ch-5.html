                <p>Smooth transitions help with focus and engagement for web visitors.
                Nothing is worse then going on a website and spotting an animation with
                a rough transitions. This will loose the trust the visitor has in the webstie
                then resulting in a lost customer. That is why smooth tranistions come into play. 
                <br>

                <p>
           
            <div id="container">    
             <img id="star1" src="../images/yellowstar.png" alt="image of a star"/>   
            
            
               
            <img id="star2" src="../images/yellowstar.png" alt="image of a star"/>   
            </div>
             
             <p>
                As seen above I have embedded two animatiosn one that is smooth and one that is
                not as smooth. I used the same code for each except I changed the transform of
                each of them to be different and also I changed the degree which they do the
                transition. Smooth transitions are responsive and they do not glitch when you
                hover over them or even click on them to activate. Making a smooth transition
                happen is playing around with different settings like the scale3d numbers and
                making sure they are at the appropriate levels for the smooth transition.

                <h3>Overall Throughts</h3>
				
				<ul>
					<li>
                        The positives is that every chapter led up to learning
                        the smooth transitions. Which made learning how to do
                        smooth tranistion much easier and time efficent. 
                    </li>
                    
					<li>
                        The only downsides would be trying to think of how
                        a web developer specifically wants their smooth
                        tranistions to end up being displayed.
