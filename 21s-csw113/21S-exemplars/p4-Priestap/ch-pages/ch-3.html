                    Transitions for web developers are very essential because it can keep their
                    audience engage and stay on their site. The simple the trantision the enough
                    it will be to grab the audiences attention, which is where first time web
                    developers have to learn. I had some positive and negative expereince with
                    transitions but it all worked out in the end.

                        The positives is that I was finally able to get my transitions
                        to work properly. Also, I am very proud at how they have turned
                        out and I will continue to work on them and improve thme. 
                    </li>

                        The downside was I had to work very hard at making sure my
                        transitions were going to work, because I would type in my
                        but nothing would happen. It was a struggle but int the end
                        I was able to get it to work correctly.
