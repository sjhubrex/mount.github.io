			<article>
                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <p>
                    When doing some digging on animation I found out that animation has a
                        similar definition when defined but depending on what type of animation for
                        specific projects. The frist definition found is from Alyssa Maio's article,
                        What is Animation? Definition and Types of Animation, which states, "Animation
                        is a method of photographing successive drawings, models, or even puppets, to
                        create an illusion of movement in a sequence" (Maio, 2020). This definition is
                        a very generalized version of how everyone would see as classic animation. The
                        second definition is from Science Daily, which states, "Computer animation is
                        the art of creating images via the use of computers, which is a subfield of
                        computer graphics and animation" (2021). These two definitions have on thing in
                        common which is that animation involves movements of an objects. Animation is
                        movement of objects that creates art forms whether it relates to being used via computers, for films, etc.

                <p>    In the above video and picture they showcases the use of web Animation of the website
                       of American Eagle (2021). The animation is mainly used with text and images that fade
                       in and stay in one place when once the user has moved onto another section of the website.
                       Also, the picture above has pictures within the website are in a slideshow format that move 
                       to the left. The contrast and alignment of the text is repetitive throughout the website and
                       the proximity is between each section. There are more pros for the animation chosen then cons
                       but the pros are that the text is within each section and is consistent throughout the page and
                       that it is accessible for people to use.

                <h3>Overall Throughts</h3>
				
				<ul>
					<li>The positives of this discussion is that it
                    was research and discovery base, which means
                    very littel coding was applied. I enjoyed
                    learning about different animation and
                    seeing it in practice.
                    </li>
                    
					<li>
						There were little struggles with this
                        discussion becuae of its simplicity.
                        A struggle would be not knowing how
                        my example was able to implement
                        the animation into their website.
                        The curiosity to learnis the main
                        struggle.
