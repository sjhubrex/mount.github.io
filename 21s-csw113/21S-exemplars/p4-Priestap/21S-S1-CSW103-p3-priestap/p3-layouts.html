 <h1> Spring 2021 Project 3 Requirements Summary</h1>

  <h3>Project1</h3>
 For Project 1 I did not have much feedback
 when it came to the rubric or the requirements. However,
 a small detail that I was missing was spaces between my
 comment tags. For example I used my comment block without
 spaces between !--comment--. When it was suppose to be
!-- comment --.

 <h3>Project 2</h3>
 
For Project 2 I was missing some spaces between my
 navigation bar, which I fixed right away. I was able to
 implement a table within my project. I had many validation
 errors a few of my pages which got resolved with the trickle
 down effect. Also, I had a few grammar typos on some of my
 pages, which were looked at and fixed. Since the comment
 feedback in Project 1 was given I was able to rid the
 comment tag of my project and update it to meta tags.
 These were the major points of feedback given and corrected
 for continuing porjects.

 <h3>Enhancements Overall</h3>
For this project I continually wanted to
  update any styles or layouts that I could. I added
  width and height to many pages and even the navigation
  bar. I also added a lot of styling to my styl sheet
  such as padding, font size, and the clear tag. I had
  added a lot of styles prior to starting on Project 3 so
  I was able to have an advantage when it came to adding
  styles.

  <h3>Screen and Style Sizing</h3>
  
   Screen and Styling Sizing is very important to every web user.
   The screen tags allow the developer to fit the screen to any
   device so the content fits properly and is in an appropriate
   layout. This is essentially an accessibility way for everyone
   to be able to read the content and have the content fit onto
   any device a person may be reading it from.
   Examples of two different views are prodided below with a code:
  <img src="images/screen-narrow-browser.jpg" alt="Browser" width="170"> 	<img src="images/screen-wide-browser.jpg" alt="Browser" width="170">
		<img src="images/screen-code-code.jpg" alt="Code" width="170" class="code">

<h3>Boxes and Styles</h3>
For my boxes and styles on my layout page I used variuos styles.
I incorporated width, padding, border styles, background and even radius
touches to some boxes. My CSS designs provide more in depth with what I
did. Examples are down below:
<img src="images/left-box-browser.jpg" alt="Browser" width="220"> 	<img src="images/right-box-browser.jpg" alt="Browser" width="220">
<img src="images/boxes-boxes-code.jpg" alt="Code" width="170" class="code">

<h3>Positioning</h3>
 Positioning can be very challening but once mastered makes
formatting and positioning conent much easier. There are many that a
developer can use including, fixed, z-index, relative, etc. This can
help a developer put the content where they would like other to be able
to acessibly access the information.
