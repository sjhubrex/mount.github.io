                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hello, my name is Gillian Maffit. I am from Mentor, Ohio. I graduated from Mentor High School in May 2020. During my senior year of high school I was able to have
                        an internship with the public relations director for Mentor Public Schools. Currently, I am currently a student at the University ofMount Union in Alliance, Ohio.
                        I am majoring in public relations and minoring in web design.
                    </p>
                <h3>Interests & Goals</h3>
                    <p>
                    My interests are writing and lacrosse. I am part of the Women's Lacrosse team here at the University of Mount Union. I am also a member of the Mount Union Public Relations
                    Student Society of America (PRSSA) chapter! My goals are to continue to write and imporove my communication skills to get a good job for my future. I would love to be
                    able to work in a school as a Public Relations Director. My other goal is to grow inweb design since I found out in schools some public relations directors actually
                    make the websites for the schools or edit them is to master coding so I can dogood in my future. Along with that, having experience with HTML and CSS is a good thing
                    to include when appling dor public relations jobs.
                    </p>
                 <h3>Website Goals</h3>
                    <p>This website I have created is for the goal and purpose of allowing people to see what I am interested in and what I know about HTML. This website could help open many
                    doors for my future goals. I want to be able to show my potential employers that I can do a lot and I am capable of anything.
                    </p>
