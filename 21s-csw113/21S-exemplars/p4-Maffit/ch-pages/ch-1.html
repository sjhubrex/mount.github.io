			<article>
                <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
				<p>
                    While looking more into web animations, I found two definitions that helped me gain a better understanding and
                    come up with my own definition of web animations. The first definition I found was “Web animations can happen as
                    a visitor is scrolling through a web page to draw attention to an element, an animation that demonstrates a product,
                    or a promotional web animation that shows off something entertainingly and engagingly” (Gregurec 2019). The second one
                    that I found said, “Web animation is basically just making things move on the web and is necessary for creating eye-catching
                    websites that enable better conversions and attract users to click, view, and buy things on your website” (Ogala 2020).
                    After reading these definitions I gained a better understanding of what web animations are. My definition for web animations
                    is an attribute on a web page that helps a visitor pay attention to an important element or the main focus on the page
                    so it will keep visitors engaged.
                </p>
                <p>
					A web animation sometimes allows users to scroll through by clicking arrows to see some of the products. The website home page
                    for Sparkling Ice (2021), which is a drink I purchase a lot, has the main focus front and center of the new version of their drink
                    they are selling, and it has arrows the users can click. When clicking the arrow it changes the style of the drink or the flavor
                    as well as the background color and it has some facts or selling points surrounding the drink. The arrows are on the side so the
                    user can go forwards through and go back as well.

                <h3>Pros and Cons of Example</h3>
                    <iframe width="365" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6P6LKK1KVuw" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <h4>Pros:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Eye-catching</li>
                        <li>Smooth transition</li>
                        <li>First thing viewer notices</li>
                        <li>Benefits & facts of the drinks</li>
                        <li>Gets main point across</li>
				</ul>
                <h4>Cons:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Very flashy</li>
                        <li>Colors may be distracting</li>
                        <li>A lot going on at once</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    Overall, this was a prime example of a web animation, as seen in my video provided this one web animation also has more
                    of them as a user will click the arrows and explore the page more.
