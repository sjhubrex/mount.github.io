                <h1>Welcome to Dr. Huibregtse's Portfolio!</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Dr. Huibregtse—my last name is pronounced hue-brex. I have been
                    teaching since 2001 with experience at all levels from graduate courses down
                    to k12, and I have come to enjoy the opportunity to meet and converse with
                    some amazingly motivated students from around the country and beyond.  I am
                    passionate about teaching, learning design and development strategies,
                    researching, and helping people reach their dreams through education, critical
                    thinking, and problem-solving.
                </p>
                <h2>My Background</h2>  
                <p>My eclectic teaching background includes teaching instructional design, computer
                    application, and web design and computer programming at colleges around the USA
                    (mostly in Wisconsin) along with general education and computer science courses at
                    the k12 level.  I have experience teaching, as well as supporting and training faculty
                    that teach face-to-face, web-enhanced, hybrid, and online courses.
                </p>
                <p>
                   At Mount Union, I work as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science.  Other roles
                   I have had include, instructional designer, senior knowledge management adviser,
                   researcher, instructional technology coordinator, SharePoint administrator, software
                   training specialist, yeoman in the US Navy, and military police in the Wisconsin Army
                   National Guard.  In addition to undergraduate work in elementary education and computer
                   science, I have a web development certification, a master's degree in computer science
                   education, and a Ph.D. in Education specializing in Instructional Design for Online
                   Learning.  So you will notice I do go by Dr. Huibregtse so please spend some time
                   learning how to properly spell and pronounce it.
                </p>
                <h2>Expectations</h2>
                <p>
                    In computing courses we focus on mastery of skills so we will rely on the languages
                    guidelines to demonstrate proficiency.  While supporting your learning journey I will
                    be fair and I'm here to support you.  Remember that learning is hard work—just like
                    running a marathon all the way to the finish line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any coach (that is the role I take as your professor) can tell you that growth only
                    comes when you stretch beyond what you think you can do and practice more than you
                    think you can endure.  When you read and research deeper, think longer, and create
                    more enthusiastically, that is when the learning really occurs.
                </p>
                <p>In the words of Michael Jordan:</p>
                <blockquote class="quotation">
                    There is a right way and a wrong way to do things.  You can practice
                    shooting eight hours a day, but if your technique is wrong, then all you become is
                    very good at shooting the wrong way.  Get the fundamentals down and the level of
                    everything you do will rise.
                </blockquote>
