      <h2>Project 2 Final Submissions</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Project 2 for this course is a piece selected by students that
      requires each student to develop independently as they replicate the process learned by completing
      Project 1.  Typically, the final version of this project is submitted by
      around midterm.  <em>Please note, we do not claim to own the copyright to the music performed in
      these Python programmed pieces.</em></p>

        <p>This project was part of the <em>CSC 399 Special Topic: Making
        Music with Computers</em> course taught at the University of Mount Union in
        Alliance, Ohio.</p>

            <h4>Adkins About Project 2</h4>
            <p>For my second Python music project, I coded “25 or 6 to 4” by Chicago. I like
            Chicago’s music because it has a lot of complex instrumentation, usually with more
            of a distinct sound than other bands of the times by blending genres. I feel like most
            of their music would be interesting to digitize, but I was partial to this song for
            several reasons. I have fond memories of playing this in marching band, which is where
            I was first introduced to it. It was a fun piece to play, because it had a saxophone part
            in the melody, something that seemed rare to me as a saxophone player. The lyrics to the
            song also resonate with me as an overworked college student—desperately seeking
            inspiration, trying hard to finish writing (or, in this class’s case a musical
            programming project) while time slips past in a way that seems unusual. </p>

            <h4>Davis About Project 2</h4>
            <p>I completed the song “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring” for Project 2. This
            song was written by Bach. I had listened to this song very often as a young
            child and I wanted to see if I could implement it in this course. I am very
            pleased with the result and I hope that anyone who listens to the piece also
            enjoys it. The implementation of this song was not easy but allowed me to
            grow my musical knowledge and expand my musical vocabulary.</p>

            <h4>Hedigus About Project 2</h4>
            <p>I chose to do the song "I Won't Give Up" by Jason Mraz. The song has a
            lovely sound without relying heavily on a repeated instrumental phrase,
            which I felt made it perfect for this project. I went ahead and did about
            half or more of the song. My musical composition has five parts - treble
            and bass Rhodes piano, Dulcimer, music box, and Taiko drum. The original
            sheet music for the piano is transcribed into my piece as the Rhodes piano
            parts. I found additional sheet music that had the vocals for the song,
            which is transcribed into my piece as the music box. The Dulcimer and Taiko
            drums are additional music to give the piece a cohesive feel. Hope you enjoy
            it!</p>

            <h4>Martin About Project 2</h4>
            <p>For my project two, I have coded in the song "All I Want for Christmas is
            you" by Mariah Carey and Afanasieff. This was not my first song choice but
            rather the song I chose after running into problems with my first choice.
            This song is containing seven different instruments making seven parts running
            from begging to end. The overall length is about 2 mins and 30 seconds long.
            In my piece, I have used many different dynamics to raise and lower the
            Instruments' volume. The last big thing I have done is using instruments
            that typically do not go together. The Instruments are 1. Pad_4_Choir, 2.
            piano, 3. Voice_oohs, 4. harp, 5. trumpet, 6. contrabass, AND 7 my
            percussion the snare. The song is easier to recognize at the begging,
            but it becomes challenging to identify the music as it starts playing.</p>

            <h4>McGinnis About Project 2</h4>
            <p>My selection piece was Vivaldi’s Spring from The Four Seasons. It feels
            very timely as we near the changing of the seasons. The mood of this piece
            is light, exciting and hopeful. I felt that a piece that creates a feeling
            of new beginnings would be a fun focus point, being that there are so many
            new and exciting things to look forward to in my own life within the next
            few months. I knew that with this piece I would be able to dive into adding
            a lot of depth to this piece with the use of many different parts. Also,
            while transposing this piece, there were a lot of techniques that we have
            learned tricks for such as repetition, dynamics, parts with similar durations,
            and more. I knew I could utilize these things that we have been discussing
            in this course and create a very interesting version of this piece.  In the
            end, I believe I have a unique and exciting performance of this classical
            composition. </p>

            <p>Hi everyone, my name is Nick Miller, and this is my piece Falling Slowly
            for my Project 2. Within this piece, I explored 4 separate instruments
            as well as percussion. I transcribed the sheet music and then altered
            the notes with the Mod.invert() function to give it more of a bass punch.
            I had a fun time creating this piece and I look forward to making more
            music with computers!</p>

            <p>This project is about a song that we found interesting or had a connection
            to. So, I choose to recreate God Bless America by Lee Greenwood. The reason
            behind choosing this song was because of the soldier meanings behind it and
            being part of a genre that I listen to daily. While coding this I broke it
            down into smaller parts that would be considered modular. What this means is
            each part is contained in its own function. While in the function the phrase
            is created and calls upon another function to create and append the phrase.
            After the phrase is constructed it is added to the score.</p>

            <h4>Newsom About Project 2</h4>
            <p>I chose to program the song, “That Girl” by Stevie Wonder, for my Project 2.
            It was a long process of breaking this song down of its many components and
            programming it to sound as close to the original piece as possible.  I am very
            happy with how everything turned out despite the late change to this song that
            I had to make.  The song consisted of 2 violin parts for the melody along with
            a viola part to compliment.  The background bassline consisted of 2 electric
            piano parts and a percussion part to carry the beat.  Overall, the piece was
            not too complicated as I completed each part, and the layers came together.
            I enjoyed the results and the journey that I took to get those results and I
            am excited to continue coding more musical pieces!!</p>

            <h4>Spencer About Project 2</h4>
            <p>In the video submitted, I will be presenting my Project 2. The music sheet
            I decided to go with was called Soviet Connection (GTA IV Theme Song) By Michael
            Hunter. I transcribed 16 out of the original 23 instruments. However, due to
            poor quality, I removed 2 of the drums from the final piece. I also transcribed
            15 out of the original 22 pages. Overall, the piece ended up turning out really
            well. While I ran into a few hiccups when transcribing and programming the
            piece, everything ended up working out in the end. In the beginning of the
            piece, the tempo starts out at 105, then it decreases to 100. Later on, it
            then increases to 146. During the piece, many of the instruments consistently
            do not play on some pages. Therefore, I had to create many phrases to
            accommodate for this. Furthermore, I attempted to keep my code organized as
            much as possible and to not write any duplicate lines of code for all measures.
            In my video, I will discuss some factors I had trouble with, such as keeping
            my code organized and getting the start times perfect for each instrument.</p>
