				<p>
					Throughout our course students have been creating a variety of projects 
					that require them to demonstrate skills learned.  This website has been 
					setup to share their hard work and creativity.  There were also a few design
					competitions along the way too.
				</p>
                <p>
                    Past projects have also been posted for projects from when this
                    curriculum was taught at the University of Mount Union and at
                    Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York during previous
                    academic years and during a <em>Kids on Campus</em> summer camp.

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">CSC 399 Making Music with Computers</h2>
                <h3>Course Description</h3>
				<p>A course exploring the creative side of computing in the context of music,
                sounds, images, and other digital artifacts. Emphasis will be given to computer
                programming for music making, live performance, and interaction. Students will
                develop several digital artifacts and elementary musical compositions, as well
                as collaborate on interdisciplinary team projects. Course is open to ALL majors.</p>
				<p>There are no prerequisites to taking this course, but don't let that fool you---this 
				is a challenging and rewarding course!  Your ability to think abstractly and work creatively 
				will increase, as will your confidence in mastering new technology.  The hands-on projects 
				will be a lot of fun, and you will develop fundamental computing skills that will serve you 
				for years to come.</p>
				<h3>Course Goal</h3>
				<p>Computing is one of the biggest forces of innovation and societal transformation
                of today. It has opened up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design,
                research, play, create, and express themselves. Knowing the fundamentals of
                computing allows a person to understand and relate to the why’s and how’s of
                this transformation. Computing is more than just computer literacy but is about
                the empowering experience that comes when one learns how to solve problems like a
                computer scientist.</p>
                <p>Making Music with Computers provides a bird’s-eye view on the field of computer
                science and introduces fundamental concepts using the industry-standard programming
                language Python with a focus on music and interdisciplinary application. We aim to
                get students excited about computing by showing them the breadth of the field
                together with the societal transformations and challenges that come along with the
                technical knowledge---with a musical focus.</p>
                <p>The Making Music with Computers curriculum is designed to provide students with
                the opportunity to develop computational thinking practices and an understanding of
                the social implications of computing and to engage in programming. There is a strong
                focus on learning through labs and projects where students have opportunities to
                create programs and other computational artifacts. Students are engaged in small
                group and whole class discussions, particularly in relation to social implications
                topics. The curriculum content is designed to foster collaboration and creativity.
                Throughout the course, students engage in pair programming, and there are ample
                opportunities for students to collaborate and be creative in learning the course
                content. This cousre will do all of this with an emphasis on and through music.</p>
