		<h2>High School</h2>
			<p class="p">Mentor High School</p>
				<blockquote><p>
					I attended Mentor High School for 4 years located in Mentor,Ohio. I was a graduate of the class of 2020. In my 4 years here I was a member of the girl's soccer team for 3 years and
					a member of the girl's lacrosse team for 4 years. I was a 4 year varsity letter winner for lacrosse. Along with sports, I was in AP English for my junior and
					senior years of school. I also was a 2 year letter in academics for having a 3.5 GPA or higher. I also had an internship with the Public Relations Director of
					my school district in spring 2020, but it was cut short due to covid-19. Along with my internship, I also got to write for our school website and that got me into writting
					for the schools online paper. With our onlie classes at Mentor High School I was able to take a journalism class which led me to wanting to study public relations.

		<h2>College</h2>
			<p class="p2">University of Mount Union</p>
				<blockquote><p>
					As I was looking into going to college after high school I really didn't know about the University of Mount Union until I was recruited by the lacrosse coaches. After
					visiting I loved it and knew this is where I wanted to go. Mount Union had everything I wanted, it is close to home, I can still play lacrosse, and it had the
					major I wanted to go into. I enrolled at the University Mount of Union in Alliance, Ohio in 2020 and I am anticipated to graduate in 2024, I plan on staying here for all 4 years I am currently majoring
					in public relations in the communication field and I am looking to minor in web design. I am also part of the women's lacrosse team and I am a member of Mount Union's
					Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA) Chapter. PRSSA gives us an insight and opens doors for future careers in public relations because we have speakers
					in from all over the public relations fields in different positions talk to us every other week which allows me to figure out
					where I want to go with my career.
				</p></blockquote>
			
		<h2>Professional Development</h2>
			<p class="p3">PRSSA Meetings</p>
				<blockquote><p>
					Being in PRSSA is actually helping me gain more information about my desired field for my future. I get to learn about how public relations is everywhere and every single company
					has a public relations section. I get to meet with professionals and learn more about parts of public relations and figure out where exactly I want to work with a publi relations degree.
					This is a great opportunity to meet people in organizations that are looking for interns in the future.
				</p></blockquote>
			<p class="p3">W3Schools Modules</p>
				<blockquote><p>
					With taking CSW 103 Introduction to Web Design, I have been doing extra tasks as well as ones we need to on W3Schools. These modules deal with the coding that goes into creating any HTML
					page. Being able to do these modules help me grow in this class and help sharpen my coding skills. This is very important to work on for my future. I have learned from my internship
					mentiond in my high school sectionlearned that in some public relations directors jobs they actully work on the websites. For example, if I wanted to work for a school district like my internship,
					they usually help with the websites for their schools. Who I shadowed for my internship told me to make sure I learned to code so that pushed me to expand my knowledge and take on a web design class
					and it is a good thing I listened because now I found another path besides public relations that I enjoy and want to continue in.
